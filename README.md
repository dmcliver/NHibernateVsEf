NHibernateVsEf
==============

This is an ASP.Net MVC project to measure the performance between EF and NHibernate.

There is also a WPF application to import the TSVs from LastFm, use the
1k database and make use to import the userprofile TSV first.

You will also have to make sure there is a local sql database first.
